Board size: 8x8

Computer Procedure: Place a piece in every row, and scan right, bottom, and down-right
                    for the highest number of in-a-row pieces


Win Algorithm: Scan from top to bottom, left to right, checking for
                four in a rows to the right, downwards, and down-right


Structure of program:
    - Column class: hold an int to represent which column it represents, takes care of gravity mechanism
    - Piece class: Holds cords relative to the board, and the char tile to represent the player or computer
    - UI Class: Manage prints to the console and player input
    - Computer Class: AI that the player goes against
    - Board Class: Class that holds the 2D array of Pieces, object shared with UI, Computer, and Column Classes
        - Will hold algorithm to check win
    - Constants Class: Holds Constants
    - main Class: Driver class
